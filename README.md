# Enemy-Color-Cordination
This code was for a school unity project where the enemies can only be defeated if the player hits the same color as the enemy in the hit box. The enemies were taged with their color and the hitbox would switch its tag every time a diffrent button was pressed. This code goes on the hitbox game object. Due to time restraints and other events happening, I had to quickly put the score system in the code as well, we are planning on moving it some where else later
